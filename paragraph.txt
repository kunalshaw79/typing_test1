 As a country of numerous cultures, ethnicities and faiths, India celebrates countless festivals in its calendar throughout the year. Among the most largely known festivals, we find Holi – in simple terms the celebration of colors but as we dive a little deeper, Holi seems to bring with it a plethora of meanings and historical, cultural and traditional significance.

Holi, to some people, is the festival of love shared by Radha and Krishna – a form of love that needs no specific name, form or shape. To others, it is a story of how the good in us always emerges victorious over the evil. While for many others, Holi is an opportunity of fun, frolic, forgiveness and compassion. Spread over three days, the Holi rituals begin with the destruction of evil symbolized by a bonfire on the first day and celebration with colors, prayers, music, dance and blessings on the other two days. The primary colors used represent various emotions and elements like blue for Lord Krishna, red for fertility and love and green for new beginnings.
